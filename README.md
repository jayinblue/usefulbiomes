# usefulbiomes
a 1.17.1 mod that adds biomes and blocks based on existing Minecraft blocks. sister mod to UsefulBlocks!

Biomes based on existing blocks and structures in Minecraft are planned to be added, along with items to go along with the new biomes.

# Currently planned (All names are subject to changes):
Amethyst Forest

Crystalised Beach

# 1.18.1
Currently, 1.18.1 isn't planned because of the changes to world gen. Once I get a couple biomes in 1.17.1 done I'll consider updating, but for now I'm just trying to figure out 1.17 world gen! 

# Older versions
I *might* update this mod to older versions, but it's unlikely that I'll update to anything older than 1.16, because to be honest I don't play anything older than 1.16

# Forge
Nope! If you *really* want to port my mod to Forge, go ahead! It would be nice to ask me prior, but the nature of the license I've put my mod under doesn't require explicit permission. If you want to port my mod at all, you also must license your mod under the GNU GPL license, as it's a copyleft license. A license is included in my mod files, please read it for more information. 

# Issues and github things
This is my 3rd project on GitHub, so I have no idea how this site works. I just click the big "commit and push" button and carry on with my day! But seriously, if you have an issue, submit it through github and I'll attempt to figure it out
